          # Tag mode (default) behavior:
          # - Scans for @claude mentions in comments, issues, and PRs
          # - Only acts when trigger phrase is found
          # - Creates tracking comments with progress checkboxes
          # - Perfect for: Interactive Q&A, on-demand code changes

            Review this PR for code quality. Focus on:
            - Potential bugs or logic errors
            - Security concerns
            - Performance issues

            Provide specific, actionable feedback.
          # Agent mode behavior:
          # - NO @claude mention needed - runs immediately
          # - Enables true automation (impossible with tag mode)
          # - Perfect for: CI/CD integration, automatic reviews, label-based workflows
